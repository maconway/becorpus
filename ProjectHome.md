# Becorpus - Biocaster Event Corpus and Tools #

The need for computational tools for the tracking of emerging disease outbreaks from text has become increasingly important in recent years, leading to the development of various machine aided surveillance systems (for example, Biocaster, Healthmap, GPhin, MedISys, Puls and Epispider).  This project provides an annotation scheme, corpus download tool, and  associated software tools for the evaluation of event based disease outbreak text mining systems in the context of the [Biocaster](http://www.biocaster.org) project.

The corpus construction process proceeded in two phases, with each phase consisting of the initial identification of one hundred documents.  The final corpus (i.e. 200 documents in total) is a union of Phase 1 ([README](http://code.google.com/p/becorpus/source/browse/trunk/information/README_core100.txt)) and Phase 2 ([README](http://code.google.com/p/becorpus/source/browse/trunk/information/README_additional100.txt)).

This research was conducted at the National Institute of Informatics (Japan) and funded by a Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science postdoctoral fellowship.
